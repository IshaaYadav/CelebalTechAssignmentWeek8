# 💬 Loan Approval RAG Q&A Chatbot

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** powered chatbot to answer questions about **loan approval criteria** based on a real dataset. This app retrieves the most relevant data chunks using **FAISS** and answers intelligently using a **Hugging Face LLM**.

## 🛠️ How the Project Works
This RAG chatbot intelligently answers questions using a combination of document retrieval + generative AI.

🔁 Step-by-Step Pipeline
1. Data Cleaning & Chunking:	The raw Kaggle dataset (Training_Dataset.csv) is cleaned and each row is converted into a readable text "chunk".
2. Text Embedding:	Each chunk is embedded into a dense vector using sentence-transformers.
3. FAISS Vector Index:	These embeddings are stored in a FAISS index for fast similarity search.
4. Query Embedding:	The user query is embedded using the same transformer model.
5. Similarity Search:	FAISS retrieves the top-k most relevant chunks from the dataset based on cosine/L2 similarity.
6. Prompt Creation:	The retrieved chunks + user query are formatted into a prompt.
7. Answer Generation:	The prompt is passed to a generative model which outputs a natural language answer.
8. Display on UI:	Streamlit displays the answer, retrieved context, and a bar chart of similarity scores.

## 🧠 Example:
If you ask:
“What income is needed for loan approval?”<br>
The app:
Finds top rows where income is mentioned alongside approved loans.<br>
Passes those as context to the model.<br>
Generates an informed, readable answer like:
“Applicants with a combined income above 6000 have a higher chance of approval, especially with good credit history.”

## 💡 Sample Questions to Ask

> Try these in the app:

- What income is needed to get a loan approved?
- Does credit history affect approval?
- Are urban applicants more likely to be approved?
- How much loan is given to graduates?
